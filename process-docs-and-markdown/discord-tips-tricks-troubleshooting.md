# Discord Tips, Tricks and Troubleshooting

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

 Discord has updated their policies to require users to have 2FA enabled in order to perform certain actions on servers. These actions include creating server events, performing moderation actions, managing server settings, and other elevated actions. This policy update is designed to improve server security and prevent unauthorized access to Discord servers. 

If you want to create events or perform moderation actions on a Discord server, you will need to have 2FA enabled on your account. The process for enabling 2FA is outlined in the previous responses. Once you have 2FA enabled, you should be able to access the server permissions you need.

Please note that the exact permissions required for each server can vary, as server owners have the ability to customize permissions for their own servers. So if you're having trouble accessing certain permissions even after enabling 2FA, you may need to contact the server owner or server admins for further assistance.

Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on Discord can help increase the security of your account by requiring an additional verification step beyond your password. Here are the steps to enable 2FA on Discord: 


1. Open Discord and log in to your account.
2. Click on the gear icon in the bottom left corner of the Discord window to open User Settings.
3. Click on the "My Account" tab on the left-hand side of the User Settings window.
4. Scroll down until you see the "Two-Factor Authentication" section, and click the "Enable Two-Factor Authentication" button.
5. You will then be prompted to choose a verification method: either using an authentication app or receiving a text message with a verification code. If you choose an authentication app, you will need to download an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator or Authy) on your mobile device and scan the QR code displayed on the screen. If you choose to receive a text message, you will need to enter your phone number and wait for the code to be sent to you.
6. After verifying your account with either the authentication app or the text message, Discord will generate backup codes that you can use to access your account in case you lose access to your verification method. Be sure to store these codes in a safe place!

That's it! Your account should now be protected with two-factor authentication. From now on, when you log in to Discord on a new device or browser, you will need to enter a verification code from your authentication app or from a text message before gaining access to your account.

## Screen Sharing

To enable streamin on Discord, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Open Discord on your Mac and log in to your account.
2. Click on the gear icon in the bottom left corner of the Discord window to open User Settings.
3. In User Settings, click on the "Voice & Video" tab on the left-hand side of the window.
4. Scroll down until you see the "Video Settings" section. You should see a "Go Live" option here. If this option is not available, make sure that your Discord client is up to date and that your account is not currently banned or restricted from streaming.
5. Click on the "Go Live" button. This will open the Go Live menu.
6. In the Go Live menu, select the screen or application you want to share with your viewers. You can choose to share your entire screen or a specific application.
7. Once you have selected the screen or application you want to share, click the "Go Live" button at the bottom of the menu. This will start the stream.
8. To end the stream, click the "Stop Streaming" button in the bottom right corner of the Discord window.

That's it! You should now be able to stream your screen or application to your Discord channel. Keep in mind that streaming may cause your computer to slow down, so it's a good idea to close any unnecessary applications before starting a stream.

## Change Username on Discord

To help maintain an organized and consistent member list, please apply the following format if you want to include a title or organization in your username:

*     Option A) If you prefer to use your name: First Name [Organization]
*     Option B) If you prefer not to use your name: Gamertag [Organization]
*     Option C) If you want to show your name or Gamertag but hide your work: First Name/Gamertag

For example, if your current username is AMZN_AmyFinch and you want to change it to adhere to Option A, you would change it to "Amy [Amazon]". If you want to use Option B, you could change it to "Finchy [Developer]". If you want to use Option C, you could change it to "Amy".

Here are the step-by-step instructions to change your username:

1.     Open the Discord app or website and log in to your account.
2.     On the left-hand side, click on the server where you want to change your username.
3.     Find your username in the member list or the chat window, and click on it.
4.     Click on the three dots on the right side of your username, then select "Change Nickname."
5.     Type in your new username according to the guidelines provided above.
6.     Click "Save" to update your username.

Please note that some servers may have specific guidelines for usernames, including limitations on the number of characters or how often you can change your username. Be sure to check the server guidelines or contact an administrator if you have any questions or issues.

For reference, here are some examples of usernames that adhere to the recommended format:

*     Royal OBrien [Amazon]
*     Finchy [Finch Studio]
*     OBWANDO [Developer]
*     Finchy

## Text Formatting

Here's a comprehensive list of all the formatting options available in Discord:

1. Bold text: To make text bold, surround it with two asterisks on both sides like this:
    **Bold Text**
2. *Italicized text:* To italicize text, surround it with a single asterisk on both sides like this: 
    *italicized text*
3. ***Italicized Bold text***: To italicize bold text, surround it with three asterisk on both sides like this: 
    ***italicized bold text***
4. Underlined text: To underline text, surround it with two underscores on both sides like this:
    **Underlined Text**
5. *_Underlined and Italicized Text:_ *To underline and italicize text, add two underscores along with an asterisk on both sides like this:
    __*Underlined and Italicized Text*__
6. **_Underlined and Bolded Text_**: To underline and bold text, add two underscores along with two asterisks on both sides like this:
    __**Underlined and Bolded Text**__
7. ***_Underlined, italicize and Bolded Text_***: To underline and bold text, add two underscores along with three asterisks on both sides like this:
    __***Underlined, italicize and Bolded Text***__
8. __***I want this to be shown in its full glory!***___
    In case you actually *want* to see your underscores or asterisks in a message (like in an emoji, for example), you can use the backslash ‘\’ key to skip markdown formatting and show the text just like it is. 
    \_\_\*\*\*I want this to be shown in its full glory!\*\*\*\_\_\_
9. 
10. Strikethrough text: To add a strikethrough to text, surround it with two tildes on either side, like this: 
    ~~Strikethrough Text~~
11. Formatting on International Keyboard Layouts
    **German:** Shift+[+] (key right of Ü)
    **Spanish:** Shift+[+] (key right of `^ (Spain) or ´¨ (Latin America))
    **French (France):** * (key right of ù%)
    **French (Belgium):** Shift+$ (key right of ^¨)
    **French (Switzerland):** Shift+3
    **Italian:** Shift+[+] (key right of èé)
    **Swedish:** Shift+’ (key right of Ä) 
12. if you want to hide a message you are showing then spoiler would be the way. This could be a way to avoid giving away the main point or a spoiler of a show someone has not seen. You can create spoiler text like so: 
    || Spoiler Text ||
13. For quoting something, there’s a simple “quote/blockquote” tag implemented in Discord. 
     You can do this by simply adding the right-carat character ‘>’: 
    > text here
     You can also quote multiple lines by using the triple right-carat ‘>>>’, or by typing out a line with a single quote ‘>’ and then holding SHIFT+ENTER to create a new line within the same quote block. 
14. This is an example of a single line code block: When displaying a line of code, file address or anything that needs a section of code or to stand out and is a single line, add a single backtick on both sides
    `This is an example of a single line code block`
15. To extend this further, if you want to represent multiple lines, then you will add three backticks:
    ```
    Stuff
    goes
    here
    ```

## Color Codes

At present, the use of color codes is quite restricted. Although there are workarounds available, they only function properly when viewed on a PC; mobile devices are unable to display colors. The example below shows how the content would appear with and without markdown:

1. [Image: image.png]
2. ```diff
    - Here's some red colored text!
    + Here's some green colored text!
    ```
    ```ini
    [Here's some blue highlighted text]
    ```
    ```fix
    Everything is yellow in fix --
    No matter the line! Or is this a lie and really Red or maybe its Blue. No one will ever know!
    ```
    ```bash
    "Here's some nice, light Blue text"
    ```

## Privacy and Notifications

## Error messages

1. When Creating an event on discord and shown with "Missing Permissions", ensure that you have 2FA enabled. 

2. If you message a member on discord and represented with a message saying it could not be sent like so:
```
Your message could not be delivered. This is usually because you don't share a server with the recipient or the recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends. You can see the full list of reasons here:
``` 
This means that you have not added them as a friend. This is normally a setting thats enabled on the other users end to prevent spam.
