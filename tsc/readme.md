# Technical Steering Committee 

This Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the formally elected group set forth with the responsibility for all technical oversight of the Open 3D Engine open source project.  

The Technical Steering Committee acts as an escalation point for conflicts within projects, encourage cross-project communication/coordination and help with project governance. The TSC is not involved in the day-to-day development or maintenance of the projects it represents, though, individuals on the committee may be maintainers and/or contributors to the projects. The committee does not make marketing or funding decisions, day-to-day technical decisions on architecture, code acceptance, or feature set but can resolve technical disputes in these areas when an issue has been escalated to the TSC by the community of the project. However, escalation to the TSC should be considered a failure of the community process when unable to reach concensus on an issue.

## Responsibilities

The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of technical oversight relating to the Project, which may include:
- Coordinating the technical direction of the Project
- Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope)
- Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects
- Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements
- Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities
- Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies
- Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager  to resolve matters or concerns that may arise
- Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects
- Coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the project with the Governing Board.

## Comittee Size

9 Seats 

## TSC Membership

The TSC voting members are initially those individuals listed as voting members of the TSC on the Project web site.

To be a qualified for a seat on the TSC, an individual must:
- Commit that they have the available bandwidth to make the time to invest in the Project and the TSC.
- Demonstrate an advanced level of professional experience as engineers in the scope of Project.
- Demonstrate seniority sufficient to access additional staff or community members to assist in their TSC preparations
- Operate neutrally in discussions and put the goals and success of Project overall in balance with corporate objectives or any particular project in the Project.

### Member selection from Inception:

From the inception of the Project to the date that is eighteen months following inception of the Project or such other appropriate date determined by the TSC, such as the point after which a majority of contributions have been made by new contributors to the Project (the “Transition Date”), the makeup of the TSC will be determined as follows:

- Four members selected by the Governing Board of the Fund; and
- Five members determined via a process to be approved by the TSC.

### After the Transition Date: 
The composition of the TSC will be as determined by the TSC by two-thirds majority vote and documented on the Project web site or code repositories. No more than three (3) members of the TSC may be employed, directly or indirectly (e.g., as a contractor), by any one entity and its Affiliates (either at the time of election or from a later job change). If if at any time more than three (3) members are so employed by the same entity and its Affiliates, then they will jointly decide who should step down, or if there is no agreement, random lots shall be drawn.  An “Affiliate” means, with respect to any entity, any other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with that entity.

## Meetings and operation
Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. 

The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.  The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the Fund.  Elections of a TSC Chair will require a two-thirds vote of all of the members of the TSC.

## TSC Voting on matters
While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community any decisions will be govered as follows:
- If any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.   
- Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.
- Except as provided in the formal TSC charter, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the TSC may decide to use a lazy consensus model for regular votes of the TSC, provided that such lazy consensus model is documented on the Open 3D Engine web site.  Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC.
- In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Governing Board for assistance in reaching a resolution.
