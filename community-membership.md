## How to become a reviewer

Requirements to become a reviewer
* 6+ contributions successfully submitted to O3DE
* 100+ lines of code changed across all contributions submitted to O3DE
* 2+ O3DE Reviewers or Maintainers that support promotion from Contributor to Reviewer

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Contributor to Reviewer.
To do this, a [Pull Request](https://github.com/o3de/community/pulls) should be created on the community repo for the supportive Reviewers and Maintainers to comment and add their support.
Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Pull Request needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting.  The nominee should plan to attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve.
Nomination Pull Requests that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

Requirements to continue to be a Reviewer
* 4+ Pull Requestss reviewed per month

If a Reviewer fails to meet the requirements, they will be given a 1 month grace period to get back to the required number of Pull Requests per month.  After the 2nd month, if they haven't returned to the required number of reviews, they will be returned to Contributor status.
