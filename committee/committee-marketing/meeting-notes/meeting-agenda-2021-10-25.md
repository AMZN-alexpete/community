Had some thoughts about publicity for O3DE

Between August 1st and today, October 21st, there have been only 8 articles about O3DE, 2 german articles,  1 which only mentioned o3de to clarify that it has no relation to a different engine with a similar name, 1 which had only had a 2 sentence long article, and one about Hadean joining as a partner. 
So I had a few ideas about increasing awareness

reddit.com/r/gamedev  is a highly active subreddit with an average of 75 posts per day, with a member count of almost 600k and a growth of 500% in the last 6 years. They have a chart in their Engine-FAQ that lists quite a few engines and how they differ based off of language, price, platforms, etc.  O3DE is not on there, nor in their wiki of "Free 3D Game Engines". According to the sub, its relatively easy to be listed. I believe it would be good to have O3DE listed, despite how miniscule such a thing may be

reddit.com/r/AMA is also a popular sub, with no requirements to posting. Can't guarantee the user engagement that would happen if O3DE did an AMA on there, but any publicity is good, no?

Other means of spreading the word might include:
-Attending conferences physically and virtually (with 1 person using O3DE as an attendee in an official capacity
-Contacting major technology publications to have them do a piece on O3DE
-Doing a podcast with guests from the GameDev industry
-Creating YT content with prominent game developers who have shown an ability to, and interest in working with different game engines
-Social media
-discord server boosts- 14 boosts allows us to get a vanity link
```

- Other items...?
